# 12V-5V 4A Buck Converter + ELRS Receiver
## Summary
The 12V-5V 4A Buck Converter + ELRS Board is intent for several foam fixed wing planes at the Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group. It includes a ESP32-C3 for PWM signalling and SX1281 for RF control over ELRS, as well as the requisite power electronics to have the system be powered by a single 12V input (1x 3S battery).

This implementation is designed to optimize and integrate the system of the foam fixed-wings, which currently requires a separate buck converter, and a commercial, off-the-shelf ELRS receiver. By implementing the two main features on a single 30.5x30.5mm board, we save on weight, size, and complexity of the foam planeâ€™s overall system.

This board does not currently integrate an ESC for high-speed motor control.
