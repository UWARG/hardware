# Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group Hardware Repository

## Information
This repository previously held WARG electricals designs (Altium Schematics, PCBs, & Libraries) from roughly 2021 to 2022. In mid 2022 we switched solely toward Altium 365, https://warg.365.altium.com/ , and have largely abandonned this repository. Ideally we would upload completed projects to this Github for safe keeping in case anything happens with our Altium 365. 
For further documentation see Confluence, https://uwarg-docs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EL/overview , or our team Discord.
