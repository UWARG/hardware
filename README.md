# Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group Hardware Repository

## Information
This repository houses WARG's older hardware designs, however, we are shifting towards using Altium 365 instead of Github to manage our Altium Designer projects.

## Getting Started
1. Download free student license from [Altium](https://www.altium.com/solutions/academic-programs/student-licenses)
2. Download [Saturn PCB Toolkit](http://www.saturnpcb.com/pcb_toolkit/)
3. Contact Electrical Subteam Leads for write access to the repository

## Best Practices and Tips
- Preface your commit message with the project name in all caps. For example "ARM: add TVS diode" or "LIBRARY: add 10K 0603 resistor"
- When modifying the libraries, notify the #ee-git Discord channel 
- Please read this article on writing good commit messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
